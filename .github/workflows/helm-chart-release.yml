# This action releases the kubewarden-controller helm chart
# The action must run on each commit done against master, however
# a new release will be performed **only** when a change occurs inside
# of the `charts` directory.
#
# When the helm chart is changed, this action will:
#   * Create a new GitHub release named: kubwarden-controller-chart
#   * This release has a kubwarden-controller-chart.tar.gz asset associated with
#     it. This is the actual helm chart
#   * Update the `index.yaml` file inside of the `gh-pages` branch. This is the
#     index of the helm chart repository, which we serve through GitHub pages
#   * Update the docs shown https://charts.kubewarden.io, on the `gh-pages`
#     branch. This is the README files of the chart(s), served also through
#     GitHub pages
#
# = FAQ
#
# == Why don't we run this action only when a tag like `v*` is created?
#
# Running the action only when a "release tag" is created will not produce
# a helm chart. That happens because the code which determines if something
# changed inside of the `charts` directory will not find any changes.
#
# == The action is just a "wrapper" around the official `github.com/helm/chart-releaser` tool, can't we just create our own action?
#
# Yes, we even got that to work. However, what we really want to do is the
# ability to tag the releases of the kubewarden-controller and its helm chart
# in an independent way. Which what the official GitHub action already does.
