# Kubewarden

[Kubewarden](https://kubewarden.io) makes it very easy to write and distribute Kubernetes admission and mutation policies using your preferred languages and frameworks, as well-known distribution methods for policies -- OCI-artifact enabled image registries.

It is powered by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), so Kubewarden policies are architecture and operating system agnostic.

Discover many policies contributed and maintained by the community in the [Policy hub](https://hub.kubewarden.io/).

Download policies or build your own once, and run it everywhere, no matter what the system is.
