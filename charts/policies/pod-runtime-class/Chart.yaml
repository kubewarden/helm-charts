annotations:
  # required ones:
  catalog.cattle.io/certified: rancher # Any application we are adding as a helm chart
  catalog.cattle.io/ui-component: kubewarden # This is added for custom UI deployment of a chart
  catalog.cattle.io/os: linux   # this means linux only, other choice here is "windows". For charts that support both, don't add this annotation
  catalog.cattle.io/permits-os: linux,windows

  # optional ones:
  # catalog.cattle.io/requires-gvr: "policyservers.policies.kubewarden.io/v1" # Declare that this chart provides a type, which other charts may use in `requires-gvr`. Only add to parent, not CRD chart.

  catalog.cattle.io/scope: management # Chart is only applicable to the management/local cluster and will be only shown as an option for the local cluster
  catalog.cattle.io/rancher-version: ">= 2.6.0-0 <= 2.6.100-0" # Chart will only be available for users in the specified Rancher version(s), here its 2.5.0-2.5.99. This _must_ use build metadata or it won't work correctly for future RC's.
  catalog.cattle.io/upstream-version: "0.1.4"  # The version of the upstream chart or app. It prevents the unexpected "downgrade" when upgrading an installed chart that uses our 100.x.x+upVersion version schema.

  # Valid values for the following annotation include: `cluster-tool`, `app` or `cluster-template`
  # See the Cluster Tools section to learn more about when to set this value to `cluster-tool`.
