# Kubewarden policy user-group-psp

This Kubewarden Policy is a replacement for the Kubernetes Pod Security
Policy that controls containers [user and groups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups).

This policy is used to control users and groups in containers.

## Installation

Once you have Kuberwarden installed in you Kubernetes cluster, you can install
the policy with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: user-group-psp
spec:
  policyServer: default
  module: registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/user-group-psp:latest
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["pods"]
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
  mutating: true
  settings:
    run_as_user:
      rule: "MustRunAs"
      ranges:
        - min: 1000
          max: 2000
        - min: 4000
          max: 5000
    run_as_group:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
    supplemental_groups:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
EOF
```

You can see more information about the setting in the following section.

## Settings


The policy has three settings:

* `run_as_user`: Controls which user ID the containers are run with.
* `run_as_group`:  Controls which primary group ID the containers are run with.
* `supplemental_groups`: Controls which group IDs containers add.

All three settings have no defaults, just like the deprecated PSP (also, they would get used if `mutating` is `true`).

All three settings are JSON objects composed by two attributes: `rule` and `ranges`. The `rule` attribute defines
the strategy used by the policy to enforce users and groups used in containers. The available strategies are:

* `run_as_user`:
	* `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
	* `MustRunAsNonRoot` - Requires that the pod be submitted with a non-zero `runAsUser` or have the `USER` directive defined (using a numeric UID) in the image. Pods which have specified neither `runAsNonRoot` nor `runAsUser` settings will be mutated to set `runAsNonRoot=true`, thus requiring a defined non-zero numeric `USER` directive in the container. No default provided.
	* `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `runAsUser` to be specified.
* `run_as_group`:
	* `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
	* `MayRunAs` - Does not require that `RunAsGroup` be specified. However, when `RunAsGroup` is specified, they have to fall in the defined range.
	* `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `runAsGroup` to be specified.
* `supplemental_groups`:
	* `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
	* `MayRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Allows `supplementalGroups` to be left unset without providing a default. Validates against all ranges if `supplementalGroups` is set.
	* `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `supplementalGroups` to be specified

The `ranges` is a list of JSON objects with two attributes: `min` and `max`. Each range object define the user/group ID range used by the rule.

### Examples

To enforce that user and groups must be set and it should be in the defined ranges:

```json
{
  "run_as_user": {
    "rule": "MustRunAs",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "min": 1000,
        "max": 1999
      },
      {
        "min": 3000,
        "max": 3999
      }
    ]
  },
  "run_as_group": {
    "rule": "MustRunAs",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "min": 1000,
        "max": 1999
      },
      {
        "min": 3000,
        "max": 3999
      }
    ]
  },
  "supplemental_groups":{
    "rule": "MustRunAs",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "min": 1000,
        "max": 1999
      },
      {
        "min": 3000,
        "max": 3999
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To allow any user and group:

```json
{
  "run_as_user": {
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  },
  "run_as_group": {
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  },
  "supplemental_groups":{
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  }
}
```

To force running the container with non root user but any group:

```json
{
  "run_as_user": {
    "rule": "MustRunAsNonRoot"
  },
  "run_as_group": {
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  },
  "supplemental_groups":{
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  }
}
```

To enforce a group when the container has some group defined

```json
{
  "run_as_user": {
    "rule": "RunAsAny"
  },
  "run_as_group": {
    "rule": "MayRunAs",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "min": 1000,
        "max": 2000
      },
      {
        "min": 2001,
        "max": 3000
      }
    ]
  },
  "supplemental_groups":{
    "rule": "MayRunAs",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "min": 1000,
        "max": 2000
      },
      {
        "min": 2001,
        "max": 3000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
