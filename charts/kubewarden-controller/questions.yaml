  # Audit checks:
  - variable: "auditScanner.enable"
    type: boolean
    default: false
    required: true
    label: Enable Background Audit check
    description: |
      The Background Audit Check looks at existing Kubernetes resources and
      periodically determines whether they are still compliant with regards to the
      policies that are currently defined.
    group: "Audit checks"
  - variable: "auditScanner.cronJob.schedule"
    type: string
    default: "*/60 * * * *"
    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    label: Schedule
    description: |
      Schedule of the Background Audit check. Follows the Unix-cron syntax.

  - variable: "auditScanner.disableStore"
    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    type: boolean
    default: false
    label: Don't store (Cluster)PolicyReports in etcd
    description: |
      If true, (Cluster)PolicyReports are not stored in etcd but using an in-memory cache.
      Note that you may need to adjust `resources.auditScanner` when using the
      in-memory store.

    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    label: ServiceAccount name
    description: |
      The default audit-scanner ServiceAccount is bound to the ClusterRoles
      "view" (allows read-only access to most objects in a namespace, does not
      allow viewing secrets, roles or role bindings), and "audit-scanner-cluster-role"
      (allows read-write to Kubewarden resources and PolicyReports).

    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    label: Number of Namespaces to be audited in parallel
    description: |
      The audit-scanner iterate over all the Namespaces in the cluster. This
      value controls how many Namespaces are audited at the same time.
    group: "Audit checks"
  - variable: "auditScanner.parallelResources"
    type: integer
    default: 100
    required: false
    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    label: Number of resources to be audited in parallel
    description: |
      The audit-scanner iterates over all the resources of a certain type found
      inside of a Namespace. This parameter controls how many resources are
      audited at the same time.

      For example, if a Namespace has 1000 Pods, and this value is set to 100,
      the audit-scanner will audit 100 Pods at the same time.
    group: "Audit checks"
  - variable: "auditScanner.parallelPolicies"
    type: integer
    default: 5
    required: false
    show_if: auditScanner.enable=true
    label: Number of policies to evaluate fora given resournce in parallel
    description: |
      For each specific resource, the audit-scanner evaluates all the policies
      that are interested about this kind of resource. This parameter controls
      how many policies are evaluated at the same time.

      For example, if 10 policies are interested in Pods, and this value is set
      to 5, the audit-scanner will evaluate 5 policies at the same time.

    label: Number of resources to fetch from the Kubernetes API server when paginating
    description: |
      When looking into a specific type of resource, audit-scanner fetches these objects
      in chunks. This parameter controls how many resources are fetched at the same time.
