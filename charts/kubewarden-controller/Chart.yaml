  catalog.cattle.io/display-name: Kubewarden # Only for Charts with custom UI
  catalog.cattle.io/os: linux # this means linux only, other choice here is "windows". For charts that support both, don't add this annotation
  # optional ones:
  catalog.cattle.io/auto-install: kubewarden-crds=1.7.0
  catalog.cattle.io/provides-gvr: "policyservers.policies.kubewarden.io/v1" # Declare that this chart provides a type, which other charts may use in `requires-gvr`. Only add to parent, not CRD chart.
  # The following two will create a UI warning if the request is not available in cluster
